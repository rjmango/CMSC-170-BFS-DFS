# Interactive Mall Navigation Assistant with Store Locator and Maze Visualization

## Introduction

Shopping malls can be overwhelming, especially for first-time visitors or individuals unfamiliar with their layout. Navigating through numerous stores and facilities can be a challenge, leading to a frustrating shopping experience. To address this, we propose an interactive mall navigation assistant that helps users efficiently locate stores, receive recommendations, and visualize the mall layout through a dynamic maze representation.

## Purpose and Objectives

The purpose of this system is to enhance the shopping experience by providing a user-friendly digital assistant that guides visitors through a mall. The specific objectives include:

- Developing an interactive chatbot that helps users find specific stores using pathfinding algorithms.
- Displaying a list of all stores along with their real-time open/closed status.
- Recommending popular or nearby stores based on user preferences.
- Integrating a visual maze representation of the mall’s layout for better orientation.
- Ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience through an intuitive interface

## Methodology

The proposed system will be developed using:

- **Graph Theory and Pathfinding Algorithms (BFS & DFS)** to find the shortest route to stores.
- **Python Programming** for backend chatbot logic and navigation calculations.
- **Randomized Store Availability** to simulate real-time open/closed statuses.
- **Maze Generation Algorithm** to create a dynamic visualization of the mall’s layout.
- **User Input Interface** to allow interactive communication with the chatbot.
- **Testing and User Feedback** to refine the system’s usability and efficiency.

## Expected Output

The final product will be a chatbot-based interactive navigation system that:

- Provides users with the shortest path to their desired store.
- Displays the list of all available stores with status updates.
- Recommends stores for users who need guidance.
- Generates and visualizes a mall layout in the form of a maze.
- Enhances the overall shopping experience through an intelligent assistance system.

## Conclusion

The Interactive Mall Navigation Assistant aims to revolutionize mall experiences by merging AI-driven assistance with engaging visualization techniques. This innovation will make mall visits more efficient, enjoyable, and stress-free, benefiting both shoppers and businesses alike.
